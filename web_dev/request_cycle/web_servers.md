3.In your own words, what is a VPS (virtual private server)? What, according to your research, are the advantages of using a VPS?

It is rented computer memory on a remote machine running an operating system. It is more reliable than shared hosting and offers more control, and is more easily scaled should a site experience a boom in popularity.
