# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
> Version control helps track changes to a directory and file as you work on it. It's helpful for working collaboratively, as teams can work off branches of a master and each version can be merged with the master when ready. A bug is more likely to be found out during code review before it's pulled to the master. If a bug should make its way to the master, it makes it easier to know exactly when the error might have been introduced and therefore easier to detect.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?
> A branch is a copy of the master (default) branch, and where writing new code actually happens. It's helpful because it's changes can be meged with the master and keeping the two separate helps prevent introducing a bug to the master branch.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
> A commit is when a changes to a branch are logged witha  message. A good message is unique and specific to the changes that were made.

* What is a merge conflict?
> It is when there's conflict between different branches being merged together.
